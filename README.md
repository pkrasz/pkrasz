## 👨‍🚀 Hi there
I am a software engineer developing applications for 📲 Apple Platform.
## 👨‍💻 About me
My name is Paweł Kraszewski, and I am an ambitious and experienced iOS Developer. My expertise includes UIKit, SwiftUI, Combine, Coordinators, Git, Scrum, LeanStartUp, and other technologies. I learned under the guidance of an experienced iOS Lead, which allowed me to quickly grasp good programming patterns and maintain clean code.
I find the process of finding elegant and simple solutions to complex problems to be truly beautiful, and take pride in writing clean and efficient code.  👌

Here you can find two simple apps I created when I started working as a Junior iOS developer, so they don't represent my current level of coding, but they can demonstrate the cleanliness and organization of the code I use on a daily basis.

Before working with code, I worked in 🍽🍷 fine-dinig restaurant as an sommelier assistant, in a 🏙 corporation in sales, and ran my own 👔 business. 
All of my work experiences taught me how to build customer relationships and run how an effective sales process, among other things.

As a hobby, I've always really enjoyed 👨‍🎨 Graphic design and have worked with programs such a GIMP, Adobe (Illustrator, Photoshop, XD).
