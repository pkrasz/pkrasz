## 👨‍🚀 Hi there
I am a software engineer developing applications for 📲 Apple Platform.
## 👨‍💻 About me
My name is Paweł Kraszewski, and I am an ambitious iOS Developer with one year of experience in mobile app development. 
My expertise includes UIKit, SwiftUI, Combine, Coordinators, Git, Scrum, LeanStartUp, and other technologies. 
Before entering the commercial market, I learned under the guidance of an experienced iOS Lead, which allowed me to quickly grasp good programming patterns and maintain clean code. 
I am deeply passionate about coding and the endless possibilities it offers in creating and building something from scratch. I find the process of finding elegant and simple solutions 
to complex problems to be truly beautiful, and take pride in writing clean and efficient code. 
This passion drives me to continuously improve my skills as a developer through learning and exploration. 👌

You can find my first apps in GitHub [repositories](https://github.com/pkrasz?tab=repositories).

Before working with code, I worked in 🍽🍷 fine-dinig restaurant as an sommelier assistant, in a 🏙 corporation in sales, and ran my own 👔 business. 
All of my work experiences taught me how to build customer relationships and run how an effective sales process, among other things.

As a hobby, I've always really enjoyed 👨‍🎨 Graphic design and have worked with programs such a GIMP, Adobe (Illustrator, Photoshop, XD).
