## 🙈🙉🙊 Hi there
I am a software engineer developing applications for 📲 Apple Platform.
## 👨‍💻 About me
I started my programming adventures in early 2022. 
I learned under the guidance of an experienced senior iOS Developer, so I was able to quickly master good programming patterns and keep my code clean. 👌
You can find my application in GitHub [repositories](https://github.com/pkrasz?tab=repositories).
Before working with code, I worked in 🍽🍷 fine-dinig restaurant as an sommelier assistant, in a 🏙 corporation in sales, and ran my own 👔 business. 
All of my work experiences taught me how to build customer relationships and run how an effective sales process, among other things.
As a hobby, I've always really enjoyed 👨‍🎨 Graphic design and have worked with programs such a GIMP, Adobe (Illustrator, Photoshop, XD).
